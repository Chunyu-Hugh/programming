# Geothermal power generation in China: Status and prospects


## Introduction
China has abundant geothermal resources with thermal value. The high-temperature geothermal belt is mostly distribted in the Medierranean-Himalayana and West Pacific island-arc geothermal belts, including southern Tibet, western Sichuan, western Yunnan, and Taiwan. Affected by the Pacific plate, a high‐temperature tropical zone has formed in Changbai Mountain, Wudalianchi, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shandong Peninsula.

However, So far, on a small numbers of countries in the world have a voice in EGS, such as U.S, Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, etc.

## The dvelopment status in China
In 2016, Jiang et al41 released the fourth edition of the geothermal heat data compilation for mainland China. As compared to the third edition, 368 new heat flux data were added, and the total number reached 1230. The new heat flow data improved the low coverage of geothermal data in China and filled the gaps in heat flow measurement in Tibet, Ngari Prefecture, Guizhou Province, Guangxi Province, and Jilin Province.  
In 2017, within the framework of the HDR ex-ploration project of the Gonghe Basin in Qinghai, jointly organized by the China Geological Survey and the Ministry of Land and Resources of Qinghai Province of China, the shallowest (3705 m deep) and highest temperature (236°C) HDR mass was drilled in the Gonghe Basin.This domain is rich in geothermal resources with a high calorific value, which makes it lucrative for the further implementation of HDR pilot projects.  

In 2018, China's Tibet Yangbajing (26.18 M), Yangyi (0.9 MW), Guangdong Dengwu (0.3 MW), and Huabei Oilfield (0.4 MW) geothermal power stations, with the total installed capacity of 27.78 MW, were in operation.
